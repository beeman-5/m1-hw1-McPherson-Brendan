## About Me ##
I am 27 years old and from Charelston South Carolina. I recieved my Undergraduate Degree from Coastal Carolina University. I love listening to Music, watching films, working out and playing basketball, fashion designing, and driving to new places. 

### Past Coding Experience ###
I have worked briefly beforehand with Adobe Dreamweaver (it was very unsuccesful and somewhat self taught for a class) worked with Wordpress to build a few sites, ran code in terminals to root  and flash ROMs to android phones (not the same as web coding) and studied a few languages briefly on codeacademy. I'm not foriegn to coding, just rusty.
